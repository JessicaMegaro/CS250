Power point presentation added for portfolio. 

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs should be clearly communicated from the product owner. Implementing the user needs is essential to developing and deploying a quality product and succeeding at seeing the vision. In order to best interpret and deliver on this, user stories are a short and clear way to break down larger tasks into clear and concise segments to ensure there is no confusion on what is desired and who is owning it. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My personal approach is to ensure that I have effectively listened to what is needed. I am goal oriented, and require a clear mental path. If I find anything else along the way it's fine, but I want to be sure that I am not wasting my own or anyone else's very valuable time. I hope to incorporate being an active and engaged team member, listening to needs, giving clear feedback on concerns or issues and making sure that I develop work that exceeds in quality. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To me, being a good team member means being active, engaged, and understanding. Being accepting that others might achieve goals in different ways is important. Refusing to belittle or berate team members to me is very important. When I develop software, I want to feel pride in not only my work and the product or service, but I want to feel confident in the way that I achieved it and know that I also learned from my team mates and was maybe also able to teach them something along the way.
